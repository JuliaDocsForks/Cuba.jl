Introduction
------------

`Cuba.jl` is a library for multidimensional numerical integration with different
algorithms in [Julia](http://julialang.org/).  Sampling of the integrand is
multi-threaded.

This is just a Julia wrapper around the C
[Cuba library](http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/) by **Thomas Hahn**.  All the
credits goes to him for the underlying functions, blame me for any problem with
the Julia interface.  Feel free to report bugs at
https://github.com/giordano/Cuba.jl/issues.

All algorithms provided by Cuba library are supported in `Cuba.jl`:
* `Vegas` (type: Monte Carlo; variance reduction with importance sampling)
* `Suave` (type: Monte Carlo; variance reduction with globally adaptive
  subdivision + importance sampling)
* `Divonne` (type: Monte Carlo or deterministic; variance reduction with
  stratified sampling, aided by methods from numerical optimization)
* `Cuhre` (type: deterministic; variance reduction with globally adaptive
  subdivision)

For more details on the algorithms see the manual included in Cuba library and
available at in `deps/cuba-shared-object/cuba.pdf` after successful installation
of `Cuba.jl`.

**Note:** This package works on the same operating systems for which the Cuba
library is available, i.e. GNU/Linux and OS X systems.

Usage
-----

After installing the package, run

``` julia
using Cuba
```

or put this command into your Julia script.

Sorry, no documentation so far, it will be added when the user interface will
reach a final state.  For the time being have a look at `test/runtests.jl` to
see how you can solve integrals.

Another Julia package for multidimenensional numerical integration is available:
[Cubature.jl](https://github.com/stevengj/Cubature.jl), by Steven G. Johnson.
Differently from `Cuba.jl`, this works on GNU/Linux, OS X and Windows as well.
